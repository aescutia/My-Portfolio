            <h2 class="section-headers">About Me</h2>
            <p> Welcome to my Website! I am a Computer Science Graduate from the University of Illinois at Chicago, and my interests lie in Full-Stack and Mobile App Development.
                However, I recently branched into Web Development.</p>
            <p>Throughout my time at UIC, I took courses ranging from Software Design to Data Science. I've utilized both Java and C++ to develop projects such as a Connect 4
                clone, a sliding puzzle solver, and a tourist app, to name a few. Through these projects, I have developed a deeper understanding of Data Structures and
                UI-Development. I’ve previously interned at Dealer Inspire where I interacted with clients through Salesforce and utilized WordPress to update live
                dealership websites. This experience has helped me develop stronger communication skills. It also gave me experience with working on live products.</p>
